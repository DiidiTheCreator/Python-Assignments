# DAY 3 - LEAP YEAR CALCULATOR
# HARDEST EXERCISE THUS FAR!
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:
# 1 on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
# 2 except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder
# 3 unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder

year = int(input("Type in a random year, and we will tell you if its a leap year!\n"))

if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap year")
    else:
      print("Not leap year")
  else:
    print('Leap year')
else:
  print("Not leap year")
