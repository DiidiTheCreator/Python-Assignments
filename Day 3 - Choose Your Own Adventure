# Rat game choices on google! Made this with mom. Completed this in 4ish hours.

You close the door behind you. You are holding a suitcase. 
You paws are a bit shaky. In front of you there is a sign

"Cathedral" Which do you choose?

Rodent City [1] or Cathedral [2]?\n'''))

     world? "...in sickness and in health..." Does this mean 
     you'll HAVE to settle down and be locked in one location
